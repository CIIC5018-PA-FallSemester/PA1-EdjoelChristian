Consider the computational performance of the hybrid cryptosystem with standalone rotor 
machine, and DES using the evaluation metrics such as computational complexity, 
resource utilized, and the total time taken and document the results in
Table 4. Analyze the results by explaining the benefits, and limitations of hybrid
cryptographic systems.

When encrypting a .txt file, the benefits and limitations of the hybrid system 
remain constant. The key benefit is the enhanced security resulting from the 
two-layered defense—an attacker must defeat the Rotor Machine's stream-like 
encryption and the DES block encryption sequentially to recover the file content. 
This layering effectively destroys the predictable patterns left by the initial 
Rotor Machine layer, providing excellent diffusion across the file.

However, the primary limitation is poor computational performance and low 
throughput. Because the entire file must be processed by the Rotor Machine, 
and then the resulting intermediate ciphertext must be processed by the slower, 
16-round DES algorithm, the total encryption and decryption time is the sum of 
the two processes. This sequential execution makes it considerably slower than 
using DES alone. Furthermore, even though the system is complex, its overall 
security is constrained by the 56-bit key size of DES, meaning any file encrypted
with this system is vulnerable to a modern brute-force attack.

1.How does the initial rotor position affect the encryption process? Provide examples
to demonstrate how different initial rotor settings produce different ciphertexts for
the same plaintext

The initial rotor position determines where each rotor starts before the first character is encrypted.
Because rotors rotate after each character, the starting point controls the entire sequence of substitutions.


Each rotor contains a different wiring, so shifting it even by 1 position completely changes:

a. Which letter maps to which,

b. How the next letters will be mapped after rotation,

c. And ultimately the entire ciphertext.

Examples:

HELLO

Assume rotor positions are shown as (Left, Middle, Right).

Case A — Initial position = (A, A, A)

Plaintext:  HELLO
Ciphertext: DUZPL


Case B — Initial position = (B, A, A)

Move the left rotor by 1 step:
Plaintext:  HELLO
Ciphertext: XMGOR

Security impact of (1) same initial positions vs. (2) different positions

Scenario 1 — Using the SAME initial rotor settings for every message

This is insecure because:

1. If two plaintexts start with the same letters, their ciphertexts start the same (classical cryptext patterns).

2. Attackers can compare messages and detect correlations.

3. Known-plaintext attacks become easier:

4. If the attacker discovers the rotor state for one message,
all messages become decryptable.

This reduces the security to the strength of a single key reused endlessly.

Scenario 2 — Using DIFFERENT initial settings for each message

This is more secure because:

1. Even if the plaintext is the same, each ciphertext is completely different.

2. Patterns cannot be matched between ciphertexts.

3. Known-plaintext attacks become much harder.

4. This mimics the idea of initialization vectors (IVs) in modern cryptography.

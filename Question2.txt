Explain the decryption process in a rotor machine and why it works.
How decryption works

Rotor machines are designed using reversible electrical/mechanical wiring.
The decryption process in a rotor machine is inherently ensured by the
physical structure of the device, primarily the presence of the reflector.
The machine is built on the principle of reciprocity (or self-inversion).
When a letter M is encrypted to E, the signal travels through the rotors,
hits the reflector, and travels back through the rotors in reverse order.
The reflector's wiring is designed such that if it connects input
A to output P, it simultaneously connects input P back to output A.
Because the entire electrical path (rotors -> reflector -> rotors) is reciprocal,
the decryption process is simply the encryption process performed in reverse using
the exact same key settings. The decrypting party must set the machine to the same
initial position as the encipherer, and the rotors will advance in the same synchronized
sequence for each character. Running the ciphertext E through the machine using
the identical, synchronized settings simply undoes the substitution work character
by character, reliably returning the original message M.

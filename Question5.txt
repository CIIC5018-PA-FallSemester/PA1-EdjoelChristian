Why does DES use 16 Feistel rounds? What happens if fewer rounds are used?

DES utilizes 16 Feistel rounds because multiple rounds of encryption are 
absolutely necessary to achieve a secure cipher by establishing sufficient 
diffusion and confusion. Diffusion ensures that statistical properties of 
the plaintext are spread throughout the ciphertext, meaning a change in 
one input bit affects many output bits. Confusion makes the relationship 
between the ciphertext and the key incredibly complex, preventing easy 
key recovery. If significantly fewer rounds were used, the cipher would 
be severely weakened. For example, using only one or two rounds leaves 
the cipher highly vulnerable because the diffusion is minimal and the 
process is nearly linear, making it susceptible to simple analysis. Even 
using only 8 rounds provides incomplete diffusion, allowing sophisticated 
attacks like differential cryptanalysis or linear cryptanalysis to succeed 
because the output of early rounds remains predictably related to portions 
of the final ciphertext. The 16-round structure was specifically chosen to 
guarantee the necessary mixing of key and data bits, making the cipher 
output appear statistically random and resistant to these known 
cryptanalytic techniques.

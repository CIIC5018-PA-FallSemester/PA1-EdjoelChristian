Practicality of a hybrid cryptosystem (Rotor + DES)
Pros

- Two-layer encryption increases difficulty for attackers.

- Rotor output randomizes plaintext before DES, adding confusion.

- If DES key is ever partially analyzed, the rotor layer still protects messages.

Cons

- Slower — double encryption.

- Rotor machines are not secure by modern cryptographic standards.

- DES itself is outdated due to its short key length (56 bits).

- Combining two weak systems does not reach modern AES-level security.

Possible real-world uses (theoretical/educational)

- Teaching layered cryptography concepts.

- Lightweight encryption on resource-constrained embedded systems.

- Obfuscation of data in simple devices (not for high security).

Not suitable for

- Banking

- Government communication

- Internet security

- Sensitive personal data

Modern systems use AES, RSA, ECC — not DES or mechanical rotor approaches.

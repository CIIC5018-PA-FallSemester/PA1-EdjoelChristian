Explain the decryption process in a rotor machine and why it works.
How decryption works

Rotor machines are designed using reversible electrical/mechanical wiring.
For every rotor:

-If input A becomes output Q during encryption,

-Then during decryption, input Q becomes output A.

This works because each rotor wiring is a 1-to-1 permutation.

Steps during decryption

1.Set the rotors to the same initial positions used during encryption.

2.Process the ciphertext through the rotors in reverse direction.

3.Rotate the rotors in the same stepping pattern used during encryption.

4.After processing all characters, the output becomes the original plaintext.

Why this guarantees correct decryption

Because:

1.Rotor wiring is invertible

2.Rotors rotate in synchronized positions during both encryption and decryption

3.Both processes follow the same mechanical stepping pattern

What is the role of padding in DES encryption? Why is padding necessary, and
what padding schemes can be used? What are the potential issues that could 
arise if padding is not handled correctly?

Padding is a necessary mechanism in DES and other block ciphers because 
they operate on fixed-size data blocks, specifically 64 bits (8 bytes) 
for DES. Since plaintext messages rarely have a length that is an exact 
multiple of the block size, padding involves adding extra, non-data bytes 
to the end of the final block to complete the required 64 bits, ensuring 
the cipher can process the entire message. A common scheme is PKCS#5 / PKCS#7 
padding, where the value of each added byte is equal to the total number 
of bytes added; for instance, if 3 bytes are needed, the padding is 
03 03 03. Failure to handle padding correctly can lead to two 
main issues. First, simple data corruption occurs if the decryption routine 
removes the wrong number of padding bytes, leaving garbage characters in the 
recovered message. More critically, an incorrect implementation can introduce 
a severe security flaw known as a Padding Oracle Attack. This occurs if the 
system leaks information about whether the padding on a decrypted block is 
valid or not, allowing an attacker to use the server's response as an oracle 
to incrementally decrypt the message ciphertext block by block.

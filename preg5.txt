Why does DES use 16 Feistel rounds? What happens if fewer rounds are used?

DES needs multiple rounds to achieve:

Diffusion:

Ensures that changing one bit of plaintext modifies many bits of output.

Confusion:

The relationship between key and ciphertext becomes complex.

Why 16 rounds?

Research shows:

- < 8 rounds → easily broken by differential cryptanalysis

- 12 rounds → somewhat secure

- 16 rounds → strong enough for practical use

If fewer rounds were used

- Patterns in input/output become detectable.

- Avalanche effect becomes weak.

- Known-plaintext and chosen-plaintext attacks become feasible.

Thus, 16 rounds provide a strong security margin.

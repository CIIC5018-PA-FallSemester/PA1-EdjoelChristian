8. Discuss the practicality of using a hybrid cryptosystem like Rotor Machine + DES
in modern encryption applications. Could this approach be applied in real-world
situations? If so, suggest few potential places where it can be applied.

The specific hybrid model of Rotor Machine + DES is not 
practical for modern, real-world encryption applications.
Both components are cryptographically obsolete: the Rotor 
Machine lacks the necessary mathematical rigor, and DES's 
56-bit key is far too small, making it vulnerable to rapid 
brute-force attack. Modern applications would never prioritize 
this slow and insecure combination when highly efficient and 
robust algorithms like AES (with 128-bit keys and up) are 
standard. However, the concept of a hybrid cryptosystem—chaining 
two or more ciphers—is absolutely essential in modern 
cryptography. Today, this principle is manifested as the 
Asymmetric/Symmetric hybrid model used in TLS/SSL: a slow, 
mathematically complex asymmetric cipher (like RSA or ECC) is 
used only to securely exchange a fast, temporary symmetric session
key (like AES), which then encrypts the bulk of the data. 
This dual-layer approach provides both efficient performance 
(AES) and secure key establishment (Asymmetric), which is why 
it forms the basis of secure communication over the internet.

Pros

- Two-layer encryption increases difficulty for attackers.

- Rotor output randomizes plaintext before DES, adding confusion.

- If DES key is ever partially analyzed, the rotor layer still protects messages.

Cons

- Slower — double encryption.

- Rotor machines are not secure by modern cryptographic standards.

- DES itself is outdated due to its short key length (56 bits).

- Combining two weak systems does not reach modern AES-level security.

Possible real-world uses (theoretical/educational)

- Teaching layered cryptography concepts.

- Lightweight encryption on resource-constrained embedded systems.

- Obfuscation of data in simple devices (not for high security).

Not suitable for

- Banking

- Government communication

- Internet security

- Sensitive personal data

Modern systems use AES, RSA, ECC — not DES or mechanical rotor approaches.

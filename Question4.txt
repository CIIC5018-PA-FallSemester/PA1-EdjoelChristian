4. Discuss the key schedule in DES. How are the 56-bit keys generated for each round
of the encryption process? What effect does this have on the strength of the encryption?

The key schedule in DES is the critical procedure that takes the initial 64-bit key and 
transforms it into the sixteen unique, 48-bit round keys (K1 through K16) needed 
for the 16 Feistel rounds. The process begins by reducing the 64-bit input to a 56-bit 
effective key by dropping the 8 parity bits. This 56-bit key is then passed through the 
Permuted Choice 1 (PC-1), which permutes the bits and splits them into two 28-bit halves, 
C0 and D0. For each subsequent round, C{i-1} and D{i-1} are independently
rotated (left-shifted) by either one or two bits, a rotation schedule that ensures a 
different subset of the 56 key bits is used in every round. The combined 56 bits (CiDi)
are then subjected to the Permuted Choice 2 (PC-2) permutation, which selects 48 bits to 
form the final 48-bit round key Ki. This complex scheduling mechanism is vital because 
it guarantees confusion and diffusion: every round key is different, making the 
relationship between the final ciphertext and the master key highly non-linear, 
and ensuring that a change in a single bit of the master key influences many bits in 
the round keys and, consequently, the entire ciphertext.

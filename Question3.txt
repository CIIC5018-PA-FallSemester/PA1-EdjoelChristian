Security impact of (1) same initial positions vs. (2) different positions

Scenario 1 — Using the SAME initial rotor settings for every message

Using the same initial rotor position (e.g., AAA) for multiple messages
represents a catastrophic security failure known as key reuse. This
practice dramatically lowers security because it allows a cryptanalyst
to align and compare multiple ciphertexts, a technique called a depth attack.
Once the analyst successfully determines the substitution alphabet used for
the first few letters of the first message, they immediately know the
substitution alphabet for the first few letters of every subsequent message.
Since all messages start with the same settings and advance through the exact
same sequence of substitution alphabets, the analyst gains a massive advantage
in breaking the entire set of intercepted traffic.

Scenario 2 — Using DIFFERENT initial settings for each message

Conversely, using a unique, randomly chosen initial rotor position for every
message is a fundamental security requirement and leads to high security.
This method ensures that each message becomes a completely independent,
pseudo-random substitution stream. Even if a cryptanalyst manages to break
one message, the solution gives them virtually no direct information about
the starting state or the subsequent substitutions of any other message.
This approach maximizes the effective key space (17,576 initial positions
multiplied by the rotor order permutations) and forces the analyst to treat
each intercepted message as a fresh attack, drastically increasing the
complexity and workload required for a successful cryptanalysis.

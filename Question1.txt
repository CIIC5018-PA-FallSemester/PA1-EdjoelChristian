1.How does the initial rotor position affect the encryption process? Provide examples
to demonstrate how different initial rotor settings produce different ciphertexts for
the same plaintext

The initial rotor position is a critical component of the key for a Rotor Machine, 
fundamentally dictating the starting configuration of the internal wiring pathways. 
This setting determines the substitution alphabet used to encrypt the very first letter 
of the plaintext. For instance, in our code, the initial position AAA (0, 0, 0) 
encrypts "HOW ARE YOU" to XNA SMT RTO. If we were to change the initial position to 
BAA (1, 0, 0), the internal wiring would be offset by one step before the first 
key is pressed. This shift immediately changes the substitution for the first letter and, 
because the rotors step with every subsequent key press, the entire sequence of future 
substitution alphabets is altered. This small initial difference results in a completely 
unique ciphertext for the same plaintext, a hallmark of the machine's high sensitivity 
to its starting key setting.

Discuss the key schedule in DES. How is the 56-bit key for each round generated, and how does it affect encryption strength?

How DES key schedule works?

1. The original 64-bit key contains 8 parity bits, leaving 56 useful bits.

2. DES applies PC-1 permutation to create two 28-bit halves (C and D).

3. For each of the 16 rounds, C and D undergo left rotations:

    a.Some rounds rotate by 1 bit

    b.Some by 2 bits

4. The rotated halves are recombined and passed through PC-2 to create a 48-bit round key.

Why this strengthens encryption

- Each round uses a different subkey, so each round modifies the data differently.

- The rotations ensure subkeys are not linearly related, reducing predictability.

- Without this key schedule, DES would be far weaker.

If the key schedule were simpler

- Subkeys may repeat patterns.

- Attackers could exploit predictable structure.

- DES would be vulnerable to differential and linear cryptanalysis.
